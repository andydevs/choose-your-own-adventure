      Everyone turns and looks at you 
      suspiciously. Then someone smells 
      the smell. "Oh my gawd!" she shrieks.
      "So that's what you're talking about?"
      A little boy says "Then how come you 
      noticed it?"

      Nobody else seemed to have noticed
      for a while. But then someone smells
      the smell. "Oh lawd! Who did that?"
      she yells. She was right. Maybe you 
      shouldn't have scorfed down an entire 
      breakfast burrito while rushing to work.
      But that doesn't matter right now. They
      discovered it. What do you do now?

      You wave your hand in front of your
      face as you wail "Aww loordy loo who
      spewed the poo?" Everyone stares at you.
      Then someone else smells the smell. "Oh
      jaizus?" Everyone around them was looking
      around for the source of the stench bomb,
      and you do the same. But then a little boy
      shouts "Whoever smelt it dealt it!". Everyone
      turns to you. "You smelt it first" the boy 
      said, pointing his finger at you,  "Was it you?"
