      Everyone turns and looks at you 
      suspiciously. Then someone smells 
      the smell. "Oh my gawd!" she shrieks.
      "So that's what you're talking about?"
      A little boy says "Then how come you 
      noticed it?"

      Nobody else seemed to have noticed
      for a while. But then someone smells
      the smell. "Oh lawd! Who did that?"
      she yells. She was right. Maybe you 
      shouldn't have scorfed down an entire 
      breakfast burrito while rushing to work.
      But that doesn't matter right now. They
      discovered it. What do you do now?

      You wave your hand in front of your face 
      as you wail "Aww loordy loo who spewed 
      the poo?" Everyone stares at you. Then 
      someone else smells the smell. "Oh jaizus?" 
      Everyone around them was looking around 
      for the source of the stench bomb, and you 
      do the same. But then a little boy shouts 
      "Whoever smelt it dealt it!". Everyone turns 
      to you. "You smelt it first" the boy said, 
      pointing his finger at you, "Was it you?"

      Everyone stares at you, confused. Then someone
      smells the smell. "Aww sweet jesus up haaaigh"
      she shrieks. "Loord save us from this man's
      asshole. Give us mercy oh laaawd". The elevator
      doors open. "Ya'll need to get some hygene good 
      sir" she tells you as she leaves.

      "It was he!" You point the finger to the person 
      next to you. "What no!" he retorts "It was you 
      man! What are you talking about?" But then a 
      little boy from the other side of the elevator
      shouts "Whoever smelt it dealt it!" The boy 
      points his finger at you "You smelt it first!" 
      the boy said, "Was it you?"

      You don't say nothing. "Well? What do you have 
      to say?" someone asks. Suddenly, everyone cringes 
      at the stench of the mound of jalepenio nachos you 
      shoved in your gob while binge watching The Office 
      last night. The jig is up. Everybody knows now. 
      All you can do is hang your head in shame.

      "I'm really sorry. It was me" you say, calmly. The
      woman looks at you for a second, and then says "whatever".
      The elevator door opens at your stop. But it turns out that
      it was her stop as well. You both walk out onto the floor to
      catch your breath. Enough time to take one look at her, and
      make a big decision that could change the course of your
      entire life

      You point the finger back at him "Well what about you?". "Of
      course it isn't me!" he retorts, You fold your arms, grinning.
      "Whoever denied it supplied it!" you say, confidently. "I got
      you now!" The boy loses color. You notice he has one of his 
      hands behind his back.

      You turn to the guy. "You... farted!" you say dramatically.
      The man is confused... but then relieved "Ooooohhhh!" He says
      "I thought you were talking about the bank robbery". Everyone
      raises their eyebrows and turns to him. His face loses color,
      as he realizes what he just said. "Uuuuuhhh". The elevator door 
      opens, and he books it outside.

      "Hey, really sorry again about what happened there", you say
      again. "It's alright, happens to the best of us". She replies,
      smiling. Her name is Taniesha, and this was the start of a
      long relationship. You tell this story to your children many
      years later, as an example of how even our most embarassing
      moments can lead us to find love.

      You watch her walk down the hall, thinking about how you
      embarassed yourself in that elevator. "Well", you think
      to yourself, "time to go to work... to my job that I hate
      to my boss who probably hates me... and to get reprimanded
      for being late". Just then, you hear a voice calling your 
      name from behind you. You turn around. It's your boss! And
      he looks none too pleased. "In my office" he yells. What 
      do you do?

      You enter the office building and sit in front of his desk.
      He sits behind, leaning back, arms folded. "You know why I
      brought you in here?"

      "Is that what you think?" He says, leaning in? You nod, smiling.
      He looks at you for a moment. "Well... you're absolutely correct!"
      He shouts, throwing his arms in the air! You're confused. "Your work
      ethic and dedication to this job has not gone unnoticed, friend" he 
      adds " and we would like for you to take on the role of manager!" 
      You're shocked, numb, but as your former boss ushers you into your 
      new desk, you feel it set in. Now all that awaits is a life of 
      moderately more expensive cars and a few more trips to Legal Seafoods 
      every month. What more could someone ask for?

      "You know we can't really have people showing up two hours
      late every day?" He mentions. "I'm sorry, but it doesn't look
      like we can continue here". You know what the words mean...
      Head hanging, you get up and leave the office, to your desk to
      pack your things.
