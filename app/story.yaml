      Everyone turns and looks at you 
      suspiciously. Then someone smells 
      the smell. "Oh my gawd!" she shrieks.
      "So that's what you're talking about?"
      A little boy says "Then how come you 
      noticed it?"

      Nobody else seemed to have noticed
      for a while. But then someone smells
      the smell. "Oh lawd! Who did that?"
      she yells. She was right. Maybe you 
      shouldn't have scorfed down an entire 
      breakfast burrito while rushing to work.
      But that doesn't matter right now. They
      discovered it. What do you do now?

      You wave your hand in front of your face 
      as you wail "Aww loordy loo who spewed 
      the poo?" Everyone stares at you. Then 
      someone else smells the smell. "Oh jaizus?" 
      Everyone around them was looking around 
      for the source of the stench bomb, and you 
      do the same. But then a little boy shouts 
      "Whoever smelt it dealt it!". Everyone turns 
      to you. "You smelt it first" the boy said, 
      pointing his finger at you, "Was it you?"
    options:

      Everyone stares at you, confused. Then someone
      smells the smell. "Aww sweet jesus up haaaigh"
      she shrieks. "Loord save us from this man's
      asshole. Give us mercy oh laaawd". The elevator
      doors open. "Ya'll need to get some hygene good 
      sir" she tells you as she leaves.

      "It was he!" You point the finger to the person 
      next to you. "What no!" he retorts "It was you 
      man! What are you talking about?" But then the 
      little boy from the other side of the elevator
      shouts "Whoever smelt it dealt it!" The boy 
      points his finger at you "You smelt it first!" 
      the boy said, "Was it you?"

      You don't say nothing. "Well? What do you have 
      to say?" someone asks. Suddenly, everyone cringes 
      at the stench of the mound of jalepenio nachos you 
      shoved in your gob while binge watching The Office 
      last night. The jig is up. Everybody knows now. 
      All you can do is hang your head in shame.

      "I'm really sorry. It was me" you say, calmly. 
      The woman looks at you for a second, and then 
      says "whatever". The elevator door opens at your 
      stop. But it turns out that it was her stop as 
      well. You both walk out onto the floor to catch 
      your breath. Enough time to take one look at her, 
      and make a big decision that could change the 
      course of your entire life

      You point the finger back at him "Well what about 
      you?". "Of course it isn't me!" he retorts, You 
      fold your arms, grinning. "Whoever denied it supplied 
      it!" you say, confidently. "I got you now!" The boy 
      loses color. You notice he has one of his hands behind 
      his back.

      You turn to the guy. "You... farted!" you say dramatically.
      The man is confused... but then relieved "Ooooohhhh!" He says
      "I thought you were talking about the bank robbery". Everyone
      raises their eyebrows and turns to him. His face loses color,
      as he realizes what he just said. Just then, the elevator door 
      opens, and he books it outside.

      Well, whatever was going on there, probably didn't matter to you.
      You weren't a cop, and it didn't look like he was taking anything
      from you. The elevator empties on your way down to the parking lot. 
      Suddenly, you feel a vibration in your left pocket. You reach in and 
      pull out an old mobile phone that isn't yours. Someone by the name of 
      "Klaus" seems to be calling you on this phone.
    options:

      "Is this Klaus?" you say, as you answer the phone. "Um... no.". Even
      with the british accent, you can tell the man on the other line is 
      flustered. "I think you have the wrong number...". 
    options:

      "But you're calling me... and your caller ID says Klaus, and-" Klaus
      cuts you off "I'm going to hang up now". The phone disconnects. "Hmm",
      you think, "curious". Suddenly the phone rings again, and it's Klaus.
    options:

      "Have a good day" you say as you hang up the phone. He probably meant
      he had the wrong number. "It happens to the best of us", you think. 
      Suddenly the phone rings again, and it's Klaus.

      "Is this Klaus?" you say as you answer again. "Wait what the-", Klaus
      reacts. "Um... have you seen my grandson? He seems to be missing".

      "Oh well, um... if you find him, let him know his granddad called" Klaus 
      hangs up. "Oh, poor Klaus", you wonder to yourself "will he ever find his 
      grandson?" And, once again, the phone rings, and it's Klaus.

      "Um... he did what? That man!" Klaus retorts "I'm going to give that ol'
      wanker a piece of my mind! Lemme try a different phone!" He hangs up. "Oh,
      poor Klaus", you wonder to yourself "how can he live with his grandson's
      crimes?" And, once again, the phone rings, and it's Klaus.

      "Is this Klau-" before you can even answer, Klaus jumps in "Oh for fuck's 
      sake! Look you bellend! Don't answer the phone!" You respond "Why are you
      calling me, then?" Klaus responds "Oh to hell with it. Listen, just keep
      the phone in the elevator, let it ring and go unanswered so we can trigger
      the explosives!" You are taken aback "Explosives?" Klaus shamelessly admits 
      to his crimes. Before he hangs up you run outside the elevator to a nearby 
      police officer. Fortunately, Klaus hadn't hidden his phone number or his 
      caller ID in any way, so the police were able to capture him and eventually
      the robber. The Building was saved by your heroism (or stupidity but it still
      helped so that's good)!

      You put it back in your pocket. Best not to let them know you didn't 
      answer right away, otherwise they might get suspicious. As you near 
      the parking lot exit, the vibrations in your pocket stop. Suddenly, 
      you hear a loud bang coming from behind you. Instinctively, you book 
      it to the exit, never looking back because cool guys don't look at 
      explosions. You make it out just in time to see the Building behind 
      you fall and crumble to bits, partially shielded from the debris by 
      the parking lot floors.

      You get in your dodge and drive out of the parking lot. A swarm of 
      emergency cars surround the rubble. As you're driving away, you 
      notice that you still have the cell phone in your pocket.

      "Right", you think to yourself, "this mysterious cell phone must be
      the key to solving the crime!". As you finish your dramatic monologue,
      you turn the car around and drive back to the scene of the crime. The
      area is surrounded. Survivors are being helped and accounted for. You
      arrive as SWAT team members are exiting their vehicles. One cop 
      approaches your car. "Stop!", he yells, "this area is off limits!"

      "What kind of person farts in an elevator and accuses someone else?" The
      officer is disgusted by the story you've told. "But anyways,", he continues,
      "where's this cell phone"? You hand him the device. "Well... it looks like
      something that someone at the station could analyze. We don't have a computer
      forensics expert here"

      "Hey, really sorry again about what happened there", you say
      again. "It's alright, happens to the best of us". She replies,
      smiling. Her name is Taniesha, and this was the start of a
      long relationship. You tell this story to your children many
      years later, as an example of how even our most embarassing
      moments can lead us to find love.

      You watch her walk down the hall, thinking about how you
      embarassed yourself in that elevator. "Well", you think
      to yourself, "time to go to work... to my job that I hate
      to my boss who probably hates me... and to get reprimanded
      for being late". Just then, you hear a voice calling your 
      name from behind you. You turn around. It's your boss! And
      he looks none too pleased. "In my office" he yells.

      You enter the office Building and sit in front of his desk.
      He sits behind, leaning back, arms folded. "You know why I
      brought you in here?"

      "Is that what you think?" He says, leaning in? You nod, smiling.
      He looks at you for a moment. "Well... you're absolutely correct!"
      He shouts, throwing his arms in the air! You're confused. "Your work
      ethic and dedication to this job has not gone unnoticed, friend" he 
      adds " and we would like for you to take on the role of manager!" 
      You're shocked, numb, but as your former boss ushers you into your 
      new desk, you feel it set in. Now all that awaits is a life of 
      moderately more expensive cars and a few more trips to Legal 
      Seafoods every month. What more could someone ask for?

      Head hanging, you get up and leave the office, to your desk to
      pack your things.

      "How about up your A**!" You pull a mic out of your pocket and 
      drop a sick diss track on your boss. "You'll never make it as
      a rap artist! Give it up!" your boss retorts. "Shut yo b**** 
      a** up!" you shut him down and go even harder on the beat. As
      you walk out the front door of the Building, your hype crowd 
      follows you. They follow you all the way to your home, to your
      studio, as you drop the hottest track the world has ever been
      graced to listen to. Jeff Bezos himself smashes into your house
      in his Blue Origin capsule and gives you a million dollars in
      Amazon Basics merchendise. Now all that awaits is a life of
